# Unit-converter
Unit converter made with using JS, CSS and HTML.

Simple idea of converting diffent types of measurement units. At the moment (23.11.2022) there is just a execution for meters, yards, feet and miles.

It's possible that I will return to this project and add more implementations e.g. executions for speed, mass, volume...
